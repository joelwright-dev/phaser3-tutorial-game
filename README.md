# Phaser 3 Tutorial Game
My additions to the [Phaser.js "Getting Started With Phaser 3" tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game)

## Running the game
Create a new folder in your www directory of your apache server, only JS and HTML are needed so this may be excusable but Phaser recommends running in a web server.

Go to localhost/thenameofyourdirectory

Play away!

## Controls

Left arrow key: Move left
Right arrow key: Move right
Up arrow key: Jump
When dead, left click: Restart

## How to play

Collect pineapples, dodge asteroids. After all pineapples are collected in a "round", a new asteroid will spawn.

## Usage

Feel free to download and modify to your liking, this isn't my original code so I take no issue in re-using and modifying this repository.
